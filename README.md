🚀 Color Mixer Automation using TIA Portal V18 & WinCC RT Advanced 🎨⚙️


To add in my learning journey, I have made a project – a Color Mixer implemented
in TIA Portal V18 with WinCC RT Advanced! 

🔹 How It Works:
✅ RGB Input (0-255) – Users enter Red, Green, and Blue values, which are converted into 0-20 seconds of runtime for respective color motors.
✅ Mixing Process – After dispensing all colors, the mixer motor runs for 10 seconds to ensure uniform blending.
✅ Liquid Dispensing – When the valve is opened, the mixed liquid flows out.
✅ Recipe Management – Users can manually input values or select predefined color mixes from a recipe system.
✅ Real-Time Monitoring – A trend view displays the water level, helping operators track the process.
✅ Alarms for Safety –
🔴 If the water level exceeds 95%, a "Too High" alarm is triggered.
🔵 If the water level drops below 5%, a "Too Low" alarm is triggered.

This project was a great opportunity to enhance my PLC, SCADA, and automation skills. The integration of recipes, trends, and alarms makes it a practical industrial solution.
